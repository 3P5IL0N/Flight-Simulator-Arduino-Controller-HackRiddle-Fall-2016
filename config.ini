% Keyboard controls for typical PC keyboard with numeric keypad.  Controls
% for a single-engine aircraft with two main wheel brakes DB_0 (left) and DB_1
% (right).  Attention:  Key names are uppercase only!
%
% Key names are as defined in Qt, but without the Key_ prefix.  See
%   http://doc.trolltech.com/3.3/qt.html#Key-enum
%
% Keys can be defined with modifiers:  Shift, Control, Alt, Meta.
%
% Variable names are:
%   DF, DG:  Flaps, gear (0=retracted, 1 = extended)
%   DA, DE, DR:  Aileron, elevator, rudder (-1..1).
%   DE_T:  Elevator trim (-1..1).
%   DP_i:  i-th power lever (counting from 0; (0..1)).
%   DB_i:  i-th wheel brake (counting from 0 (left brake); (0..1))
%
% Manipulators are:
%   set(var, value):  Set var to value.
%   add(var, delta [, min, max]):  Add delta to var, keep it between min
%                                  and max if given.
%   toggle(var):  Set var to 0 if it's 1 or to 1 otherwise.
%   toggle(var, min, max, step) Change var between min and max adding step.

% This keymapping works well on standard US keyboards with NumLock switched off
% and on reduced keyboards without the numeric keypad by providing some
% alternate mappings.  Also works with most European type keyboards, as the
% only punctuation characters used are the period and comma (for brakes).
%
% The key_press list defines actions to be executed on key presses with
% an optional modifier key.  For set() statements with nonzero value, the
% corresponding variable is set to zero when the key is released.
